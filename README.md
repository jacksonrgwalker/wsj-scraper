# Wall Street Journal Scraper

This code can be used to scrape article metadata from the Wall Street Journal. For now, consider it a work in progress.
This scraper was written in vanilla python with requests and is meant to be run locally with a single thread due to banning/rate limiting concerns. One could easily extend the scraping strategy with proxies or distributed clients to speed up the process. 

This is for educational purposes only. Please do not use this code to scrape the Wall Street Journal.

## The Data
The article metadata, which includes items such as 
 - headline
 - summary
 - leading paragraph
 - author
 - date and time
 - subjects mentioned
 - company ticker symbols
 - etc.
can be used for a variety of purposes. This code was originally written for a research project to use language models and text data to predict stock market movements.

# Set Up

## Install Dependencies
I use `conda` as a package manager. To learn more about these, see my [post about it](https://jwalk.io/projects/how-to-run-my-code).

To install the dependencies for this project, run the following command from the root directory of this project:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Running the Code

See `example.ipynb` for an example of how to use run the code from a notebook.
